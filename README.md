# basic-info-site-node

A basic informational page created using Node.

The object of this project was to create three pages which could be navigated to using path names in the url.
If no path name was provided the user would be directed to the index.html page, if the path /about was provided then the user would be directed to the about.html page, likewise for contact-me.
If a pathname was provided aside from these then the user would be directed to the 404.html page.
If for some reason the 404 page couldn't load a text 404 error would be displayed instead.
